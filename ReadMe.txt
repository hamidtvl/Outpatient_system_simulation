this code was developed during simulation course as Uottawa.
it simulates an outpatient clinic system for 60 days having 2 nurses(servers). the code is flexible and I used it to try different combinations of the number of servers and also different input rate of out patients .



For the python code, I tried my best to clarify the code as much as possible by commenting almost every line. If there is still any question on how the code works, please contact ME.

*Variables get reset after each day (each simulation scenario is 60 day long). Therefore, the remaining variable at the end of the simulation just shows the output variables and results of day 60*

**If you want to see all outputs of 60 days, you have to see .CVS files for each scenario.**

***the outputs are randomly generated, we did not set random.seed to seize the outputs. Therefore, if you run the code you will get slightly different results. (obviously on average, outputs yield same results)***
